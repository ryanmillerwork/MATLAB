% Now we draw our sequence of silence and beeps. You could obviously put

% show what is going on

% Stop playback, regardless whether it has finished or not. One would hope
% it had as the length of our drawing was the length of the beep. However,
% see https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/psychtoolbox/conversations/messages/20863
% for more details. Here I have taken the approach that the visuals are
% what is most important and the beep should simply be stopped after the
% visuals have finished, regardless whether in reality there are timing
% differences due to how soundcards may function. One could easily do it
% the other way i.e. have timing controled directly by the sound and
% terminate the visuals based on this. Note also we use Screen('Flip', window)
% So our visual timing might not be all the great. Full explanation in
% "Accurate Timing Demo" and the related "Wait Frames Demo"
